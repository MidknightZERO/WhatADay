## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content creator, I want to record my thoughts or upload audio files, have them automatically transcribed by AI, and export the content in various social media formats so that I can quickly create engaging content across multiple platforms without manual writing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has signed in with Google, **When** they record a voice note, **Then** the system transcribes it and saves it to their account
2. **Given** a user has a saved transcription, **When** they select "Export to Twitter", **Then** the system generates a 140-character tweet version
3. **Given** a free tier user has used their daily limit, **When** they try to create new content, **Then** the system shows upgrade prompt with banner ads
4. **Given** a paid user wants to export content, **When** they select any format, **Then** the system processes unlimited exports without ads
5. **Given** a user uploads an audio file, **When** the file is processed, **Then** the system transcribes it and makes it available for export

### Edge Cases
- What happens when AI transcription fails or returns poor quality?
- How does system handle very long audio files (>10 minutes)?
- What happens when user exceeds their subscription limits?
- How does system handle corrupted or unsupported audio files?
- What happens when payment processing fails during subscription?
