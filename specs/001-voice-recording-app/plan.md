- E2E tests for critical user flows (record → transcribe → export)
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle enforced

### ✅ Performance & Scalability Compliance
- Code splitting and lazy loading for optimal performance
- Database query optimization and caching
- Core Web Vitals compliance (<3s load, <1.5s interaction)
- Efficient audio processing and storage

### ✅ Security First Compliance
- Google OAuth for authentication
- HTTPS everywhere with secure headers
- Input validation and sanitization
- Stripe secure payment processing
- Regular security audits and dependency updates

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 - Web application (frontend + backend)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - AI transcription service selection and integration patterns
   - Audio file processing and storage optimization
   - Social media content formatting best practices
   - Stripe subscription management implementation
   - Supabase real-time features for live updates

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research Google AI/Gemini API for audio transcription"
   Task: "Research best practices for audio file processing in web apps"
   Task: "Research social media content formatting patterns"
   Task: "Research Stripe subscription management patterns"
   Task: "Research Supabase real-time features for live updates"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`:
   - Decision: Google AI/Gemini API for transcription
   - Rationale: High accuracy, reasonable pricing, good documentation
   - Alternatives considered: OpenAI Whisper, Azure Speech

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - User: id, email, subscription_tier, usage_count, created_at
   - Recording: id, user_id, audio_url, duration, format, created_at
   - Transcription: id, recording_id, text, confidence_score, created_at
   - Export: id, transcription_id, format, content, created_at
   - Subscription: id, user_id, tier, status, stripe_customer_id

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - POST /api/auth/google - Google OAuth authentication
   - POST /api/recordings - Upload audio file
   - POST /api/recordings/{id}/transcribe - Start transcription
   - GET /api/transcriptions/{id} - Get transcription status
   - POST /api/exports - Generate content export
   - GET /api/subscriptions - Get user subscription info
   - POST /api/subscriptions - Create/update subscription

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint with request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail initially (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Record → Transcribe → Export flow
   - Subscription limit enforcement
   - Payment processing scenarios

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType cursor`

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No violations detected - approach maintains constitutional compliance.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
